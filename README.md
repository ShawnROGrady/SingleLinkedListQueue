# SingleLinkedListQueue

I am just starting to learn JavaScript and figured a good way to familarize myself with the new language was to make something similar to what I have made in the past with C++ (language I havbe most experience with)

Making a single linked list queue seemed like a logical starting point because it is a familiar data structure, but has enough complextiy for me to actually learn about the intricacies of using JavaScript

My end goal is to implement a single linked list queue that takes user input to perform the following four functions:
  1. enqueue a value
  2. dequeue a value
  3. print the entire queue
  4. close the program

This program is intended for personal education, and I plan on updating it as I learn more concepts in JavaScript
